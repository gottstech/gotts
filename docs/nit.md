# New Design of Gotts Non-Interactive Transaction

## Old Design

The [original design of Gotts Non-Interactive Transaction](https://github.com/gottstech/gotts/blob/v0.0.6/docs/intro.md#gotts-non-interactive-transaction) has been completely implemented on node version [v0.0.6](https://github.com/gottstech/gotts/releases/tag/v0.0.6) and wallet version [v0.0.6](https://github.com/gottstech/gotts-wallet/releases/tag/v0.0.6).

It use the Bitcoin style Public Key Hash to lock the output. To spend a Non-Interactive Output, a Signature with the corresponding revealed Public Key must be provided as the unlocker. This is an intuitive and simple design, since the concept of P2PKH (Pay-To-Public-Key-Hash) is well known in crypto world.

But the cost of combining the Bitcoin-style P2PKH with Mimblewimble is not trivial. The NIT (Non-Interactive Transaction) output need a `OutputLocker` structure which is `65-bytes` bigger than original Mimblewimble native output. And when spending this NIT output, an additional `InputUnlocker` is needed for unlocking it, which is `104-bytes` length. Considering the typical Gotts interactive transaction size is just `244` bytes, neither `OutputLocker` nor `InputUnlocker` is trivial for Gotts transaction. 

Let's recall these two data structure here:
```Rust
struct OutputLocker {
	/// The Hash of 'Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash'.
	p2pkh: Hash,
	/// The 'R' for ephemeral key: `q = Hash(secured_w || p*R)`.
	R: PublicKey,
	/// A secured path message which hide the key derivation path and the random w of commitment.
	spath: SecuredPath,
}

struct InputUnlocker {
	/// Nonce for the signing message.
	nonce: u64,
	/// The signature for the output which has a locked public key / address.
	sig: Signature,
	/// The public key.
	pub_key: PublicKey,
}
```

Some examples here for the old design, taken from the working wallet version [v0.0.6](https://github.com/gottstech/gotts-wallet/releases/tag/v0.0.6).

The transaction size of above non-interactive transaction example (1 Input with the _Unlocker_ and 2 Outputs) is 412 bytes.

Recently, I have been thinking whether it will be a better design to change back to pure Mimblewimble style "locker", i.e. the Pedersen Commitment, to get a more compact Non-Interactive Transaction solution.

## Mimblewimble-Style "Locker"

If considering the classic PKH (Pulic Key Hash) or Script Hash, i.e. the typical Bitcoin-style "locker", is an efficient way for locking, the Pedersen Commitment could be a better way, which can "lock" both the owner's Public Key and the output value, and it's capable to lock multiple Public Keys.

## The Prerequisite Researches

### ComSig Signature

There's a [ComSig signature scheme](https://github.com/gottstech/gotts/wiki/ComSig-Signature), which is a simple Schnorr signature with Pedersen commitment as key. 

The procedure of a ComSig, for a Pedersen commitment `C=x*G+w*H` ,is:

1. Select two random numbers `k1` and `k2`, calculate a Pedersen commitment `R=k1*G+k2*H`.
2. Calculate `e = Hash(R || C || m)`, where `m` is the signing message.
3. Calculate `k1 + e*x` as `u`, calculate `k2 + e*w` as `v`.
5. Done. The signature is `(R,u,v)`, for Pedersen Commitment `x*G + w*H` as signature public key.

Then anyone can verify this signature with the open Pedersen Commitment `C = x*G + w*H`, if:
```
u*G + v*H = R + e*C
```

### Stealth Address

In a blockchain system, address is an essential primitive which is used in transaction. The Stealth Address scheme is designed to protect the recipient privacy.

A prerequisite research on the stealth address has been done [here](https://github.com/gottstech/gotts/wiki/Stealth-Address) and the Gotts Stealth Address is designed as _(A<sub>i</sub>,B<sub>i</sub>,i)_, where _A<sub>i</sub>_ is the recipient _public spend key_ and _A<sub>i</sub>_ is the recipient _public view key_, _i_ is the child number which is within _[0,2<sup>31</sup>-1]_.

## New Design of Mimblewimble Non-Interactive Transaction

### Warm-up and Review: Mimblewimble/Grin Interactive Transaction Design

Looking back the Mimblewimble/Grin Interactive Transaction design, with 1 input and 2 outputs as example:

_(r<sub>i</sub>&ast;G + v<sub>i</sub>&ast;H) + (excess'+ offset&ast;G) = (r<sub>c</sub>&ast;G + v<sub>c</sub>&ast;H) + (r<sub>r</sub>&ast;G + v<sub>r</sub>&ast;H) + (0+fee&ast;H)_

Where

- _(r<sub>i</sub>&ast;G + v<sub>i</sub>&ast;H)_ is the spending coin, i.e. the input, which is selected by the sender.
- _(r<sub>c</sub>&ast;G + v<sub>c</sub>&ast;H)_ is the change coin, which is created by the sender.
- _(r<sub>r</sub>&ast;G + v<sub>r</sub>&ast;H)_ is the sending coin which is created by the receiver.
- _r<sub>i</sub>_ and _r<sub>c</sub>_ are sender's private keys, _r<sub>r</sub>_ is receiver's private key.
- _v<sub>i</sub>_ is the input/spending coin amount, _v<sub>r</sub>_ is the sending coin amount for the receiver, _v<sub>c</sub>_ is the change amount.
- _fee_ is the transaction fee for miner who validate and package this transaction.
- _offset_ is the so-called "kernel offset", which is a random value selected by the sender. _offset_ is transmitted as part of the transaction data, but only packaged into the block header as the "total offset", which accumulate all transaction _offset_ value since the Genesis block. i.e. _offset_ is not available on the chain data.
- _excess'_ is the so-called "public excess", which is the public key for transaction kernel signature.

And we have the following relationships:

- _v<sub>i</sub> = v<sub>c</sub> + v<sub>r</sub> + fee_, which is used to calculate the change coin amount _v<sub>c</sub>_. 
- _excess' = (r<sub>c</sub>-r<sub>i</sub>-offset)&ast;G + r<sub>r</sub>&ast;G_, which is used to calculate the "public excess".

The Mimblewimble/Grin signature theme is the standard usage of Schonorr 2-of-2 aggregated signature: 

1. The sender notify the receiver his/her public key _P<sub>1</sub> = (r<sub>c</sub>-r<sub>i</sub>-offset)&ast;G_ and a nonce _R<sub>1</sub> = k<sub>1</sub>&ast;G_.
2. The receiver take his/her public key _P<sub>2</sub> = r<sub>r</sub>&ast;G_ and a nonce _R<sub>2</sub> = k<sub>2</sub>&ast;G_, calculate _P = P<sub>1</sub>+P<sub>2</sub>_ and _R = R<sub>1</sub>+R<sub>2</sub>_.
3. The receiver send back to the sender: _P<sub>2</sub>_, _R<sub>2</sub>_, and the partial signature _s<sub>1</sub> = k<sub>2</sub>+e*r<sub>r</sub>_, where _e = Hash(R || P || m)_.
4. The sender calculate his/her own partial signature __s<sub>2</sub> = k<sub>1</sub>+e*(r<sub>c</sub>-r<sub>i</sub>-offset)_, then aggregate both partial signatures by _s = s<sub>1</sub>+s<sub>2</sub>_, to get the final aggregated signature: _(R, s)_ and the final public key (i.e. the public excess): _P = P<sub>1</sub>+P<sub>2</sub>_.

Then, we have a "Transaction Kernel" as part of this transaction data, which include the transaction fee info and the signature data. Here is the pseudo-code of a transaction kernel data structure:
```Rust
struct TxKernel {
	fee: u64,
	excess': Commitment,
	excess_sig: Signature,
}
```

### Non-Interactive Transaction Design for Mimblewimble

Comparing to above Mimblewimble/Grin Interactive Transaction theme, now let's come to the new designed Mimblewimble Non-Interactive Transaction theme.

Still with the example which has 1 input and 2 outputs:

_(x<sub>i</sub>&ast;G + w<sub>i</sub>&ast;H) + Excess = (x<sub>c</sub>&ast;G + w<sub>c</sub>&ast;H) + (A<sub>i</sub>+B<sub>i</sub> + R'.x&ast;H)_

Where

- _(x<sub>i</sub>&ast;G + w<sub>i</sub>&ast;H)_ is the spending coin, i.e. the input, which is selected by the sender.
- _(x<sub>c</sub>&ast;G + w<sub>c</sub>&ast;H)_ is the change coin, which is created by the sender.
- _x<sub>i</sub>_ and _x<sub>c</sub>_ are sender's private keys.
- _(A<sub>i</sub>+B<sub>i</sub> + R'.x*H)_ is the sending coin which is **also** created by the **sender**, where _A<sub>i</sub>_ and _B<sub>i</sub>_ are the elements of a receiver's wallet address, and _R'=r&ast;B<sub>i</sub>_ where _r_ is a random secret selected by the sender, _R'.x_ is the point _R'_ x-coordinator.
- _Excess_ is the transaction public excess.

And we have the following relationships:

- _v<sub>i</sub> = v<sub>c</sub> + v<sub>r</sub> + fee_, which is used to calculate the change coin amount _v<sub>c</sub>_. 
- _Excess = (x<sub>c</sub>-x<sub>i</sub>)&ast;G + (A<sub>i</sub>+B<sub>i</sub> + w<sub>e</sub>&ast;H)_, where _w<sub>e</sub> = (w<sub>c</sub> - w<sub>i</sub> + R'.x) mod p_.

The _Excess_ is transmitted as part of the transaction data, but only packaged into the block header as the _Total Excess_, which accumulates all transactions _Excess_ value since the Genesis block. i.e. _Excess_ is not available on the block and chain data.

For the transaction signature public key, we define a _I_ for non-interactive transaction as the total inputs:

_I = SUM(inputs)_

Where, _I = x<sub>i</sub>&ast;G + w<sub>i</sub>&ast;H_ for above example with single input.

Using the _ComSig_ signature scheme, which only need to be executed on the sender side, a 96-bytes signature will be attached into the transaction, and as the additional data, both the _R_ and the _i_ (or an encoded _i'_) will be packed into the transaction.

With this non-interactive transaction scheme, the _Output_ data structure may be defined as:
```Rust
struct Output {
	features: OutputFeatures,
	commit: Commitment,
	v: u64,
	R: PublicKey,
	i: u32,
}
```
The size of this _Output_ data structure is `1+33+8+33+4 = 79` bytes.

And the _Transaction Kernel_ data structure may be defined as:
```Rust
struct TxKernel {
	features: KernelFeatures,
	accumulate_inputs: Commitment,
	excess_sig: Signature,
}
```
The size of this _Transaction Kernel_ data structure for a plain feature is `1+4+33+96 = 134` bytes.

The _Transaction_ data structure may be defined as:
```Rust
struct Transaction {
	excess: Commitment,
	inputs: Vec<Input>,
	outputs: Vec<Output>,
	kernels: Vec<TxKernel>,
}
```
With all these data structures, the size of a typical transaction with 1 Input and 2 Outputs is `33+(1+33)+79*2+134 = 359` bytes, which saves `67` bytes (or `15%`) data comparing to `426` bytes in the old non-interactive transaction scheme, even with the added _Stealth Address_ feature.

In case one transaction contains multiple payments (i.e. multiple outputs), this non-interactive transaction design is even more optimal than the interactive transaction even only on the size point of view. For example, for a transaction with 1 Input and 3 Outputs, the size is `33+(1+33)+79*3+134 = 438` bytes, whereas two old interactive transactions need `(1+33)*2+(1+33+8+12)*4+102*2 = 488` bytes, which contains 2 Inputs, 4 Outputs and 2 transaction kernels.

### Transaction Size Comparing

| Size (Bytes) | Old Interactive Transaction | Old Non-Interactive Transaction | New Non-Interactive Transaction |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| 1 payment with 1 Input   | 244 | 309  | 359 |
| 2 payments with 1 Input   | 244*2=488  | 309*2=618  | 359+79=438 |
| 3 payments with 1 Input   | 244*3=732  | 309*3=927  | 359+79*2=517 |

Notes:

- Suppose the old non-interactive transaction doesn't include any _InputUnlocker_, meaning the Input is not a non-interactive transaction output.
- Suppose the old interactive transaction doesn't include any _InputUnlocker_, meaning the Input is not a non-interactive transaction output.
- The new non-interactive transaction has the additional _Stealth Address_ feature.
