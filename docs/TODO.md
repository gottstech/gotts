 * [x] Explicit Amount Transaction
 * [x] Non-Interactive Transaction
 * [ ] Transaction Proof (Wallet Only)
 * [ ] Interactive Transaction Data Encryption (Wallet Only)
 * [ ] Transaction Kernel Pruning
 * [ ] Price Feeder
 * [ ] Price Feeder Staking and Reward
 * [ ] Price Feeder Fault Evidence, Penalty, and Blacklist of Price Feeder
 * [ ] Stable-Coins Conversion Transaction
 * [ ] Wallet GUI
 * [ ] Proof of Work Adaptation
 * [ ] Website, logo design and all the cool stuff.
 
 Don't worry, we'll get there, with your help.
